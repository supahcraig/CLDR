# Set Up Profiler Cluster

Go to top level Clodera Data Catalog

Setup the Profiler for your env.   It doesn't let you select which env, because it already knows which one is yours.  So what if you have multiples?

Click Get Started

This creates a data hub cluster in your environment.
>> need to understand what runs where; there is an architecture diagram floating around that makes it look like Data Catalog runs on the Cloudera side rather than the client side
